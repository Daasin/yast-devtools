$Id$

This is a collection of scripts that I use to build YaST from SVN.
The main feature is that everyting is installed to ~/pfx, not /usr.
The prefix is not used everywhere yet[1], and RPMs don't work with it
either.

The scripts normaly live in my ~/bin so put them somewhere in $PATH.

The master is "recreate" which calls the others.

[1]: Notably the perl bindings install the libraries to the usual
Perl location under /usr, so make install will not work as a regular
user. I ususally sudo make install for that directory and then chown
the target to myself.

This preliminary package features two programs: yxp, which constructs
a XML version of the parse tree of an YCP file, and ycp-grep, which
uses yxp to search this tree.

* Requirements:
Flex
Bison
A recent libxml2[-devel]

* Installation:
cd yxp-1.0
make

* Examples
# find variable declarations
./ycp-grep vardecl bitand.ycp
# find the bitwise and operator
./ycp-grep 'CHAR[string()="&"]' <bitand.ycp
# find the definition of OpenDialog
find /usr/share/YaST2 -name \*.ycp -exec \
  ./ycp-grep 'definition_symbol/SYMBOL[string()="OpenDialog"]' {} \;

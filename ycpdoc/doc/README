ycpdoc: The YaST2 ycp Documentation Tool.
        Processes special comments in ycp file and creates
        html file from them. Uses the same comment syntax as
        kdoc/ydoc. Supported tags:
            @param name description
            @return type description 
            @example anything
            @see function
            @see file#function
            @see file#
            @see <a href="uri">text</a>
        All tags except @see can be multiline.

        Also processes initial comment of file if it starts at the
        first line.

        See YaST2 Documentation public/Developers/Coding/rules.html
        for example.

Usage:
        ycpdoc -h 
        ycpdoc [-i] [-] [-d<dir>] file1.ycp [file2.ycp file3.ycp ...]

        -i      Do not generate index.html (intro.html, files.html)
        -h      Show this help screen
        -       Writes output to stdout. Does not generate indexes.
                If there are more input files, generates only one
                output html file
        -d<dir> Output files are placed to directory <dir>
        -o      Old style of index: creates only index.html
            

Examples:
        The most common use (I believe):
           cd doc/autodocs
           ycpdoc -d. ../../src/printconf*ycp
        Creates index.html and one html file for each ycp file.

        Generate html file to stdout. Skip index:
           ycpdoc - file.ycp

        Examples in this directory were generated simply:
           /usr/lib/YaST2/bin/ycpdoc -n *ycp

For example of comments in ycp file, please see example.ycp and modules.ycp.
You can also look at generated index.html, intro.html, files.html, example.html
and modules.html.

Paranoism:
        ycpdoc reports functions without comment and functions that have
        undocumented arguments and arguments that are documented but do not
        exist.
